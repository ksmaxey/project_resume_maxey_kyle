# Resources

* [jQueryScript.net](http://www.jqueryscript.net/chart-graph/Animated-Configurable-Skill-Bar-Plugin-with-jQuery-Skills-Bar.html)
  * With this jQuery plugin, I was able to create a very nice skills slider bar to highlight my experience level with various skills.  I made a few adjustments from the original version however by removing the percentage values, changing the titles, and modifying the color scheme.* [Type It](http://macarthur.me/typeit/)
  * With this plugin, I created the text that says "Please hire me!"  It is a very versatile plugin that I look forward to working with more in the future.  It is easily customizable and can type, backspace, and handle multiple lines of text using a single span tag within the HTML.

* Aside from the above links, I did not use any resources outside of the lecture and my notes on this assignment.
